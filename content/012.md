## Why?

### Elm
* responsible, expressive, safe, proper.
* structuring and restructuring stuff is a breeze (stay tuned for demo).
* sometimes, though, it's just nice to do a `$('.everything').fadeOut()`. Elm says no can do!

### JavaScript
* gives a whole lot of freedom to interact with third-party libraries.
* the same freedom makes me crash and burn as soon as logic and error handling comes into play.
