## How Albatross is built

### JavaScript services

* our not very bright, but faithful worker bees: just draw a map, just reload an audio tag.
* little or no `if`, `try/catch` (they're awkward).
* no `fetch` or `promises` (they bite and cause nightmares).
* no `typeof a === 'undefined' || a === null`.
* just some very clear messages from Elm and very clear messages back into Elm.
