## How Albatross is built

### Elm brain

* hangs on to the state of the UI (`model`).
* defines all ways it can change (`messages`), and the changes themselves (`updates`).
* renders the core of the UI (`view`), wires up event listeners to these ways of changes.
* subscribes to stuff (time, websockets, outside JavaScript).
* runs commands (networks requests, messages to outside JavaScript).
* outsources all the stuff it cannot do.
