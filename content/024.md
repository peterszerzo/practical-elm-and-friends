## Elm Brain - update

The update function takes a message and the old state of the UI as arguments. It returns two things (like before):
* the new model.
* a command (e.g. http) that sends another message when completed.

```
update msg model =
  case msg of
    SetActiveSoundId id ->
      ({model | activeSoundId = id}, reloadAudioCommand)
    ...
```
