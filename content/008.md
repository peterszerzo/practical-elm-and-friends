## Elm in a nutshell

* purely functional language: no objects, not even `for` loops, juuust some functions.
* brilliant type system - always know what you get.
* no runtime errors. If you find one, just file it as a compiler bug.
* a rock-solid package manager that yells at you if a change in a package's API breaks semantic versioning.
* a real clever way to structure front-end code, one that emerges naturally from the design of the language (just parroting back what I heard at a talk).
* built with the developer in mind. Pleasantness all over.
