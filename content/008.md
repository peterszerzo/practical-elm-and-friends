## Elm in a nutshell

* purely functional language: no objects, not even `for` loops, juuust some functions.
* brilliant type system - always know what you get.
* no runtime errors. If you find one, just file it as a compiler bug.
* brilliant package manager.
* a real clever way to structure front-end code, one that emerged naturally from the language.
* built with the developer in mind. Just pleasant.
